# DockerIDE

A full Linux development environment running inside Docker, accessible via VNC.
- Complete Linux development toolchain
- Fully scriptable and integratable into existing development workflows
- Visual desktop environment with a true Linux GUI
- Ideal for developers who want a full Linux workstation experience without installing Linux locally

## Roadmap / Planned Enhancements

Persistent volume configuration to ensure:
- Git repositories and workspace data remain intact across restarts, allowing the environment to function as a long-lived workstation rather than an ephemeral container
