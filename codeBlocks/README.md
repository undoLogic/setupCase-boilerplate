# CodeBlocks

CodeBlocks are modular building blocks that form the foundation of a SetupCase project.

Provide predefined files, structures, and tooling

Imported and layered automatically on top of a CakePHP project during initialization

Designed to be non-destructive and extensible

Updated over time as SetupCase evolves, allowing improvements to be pushed forward without rewriting projects

This approach enables a layered workflow where new functionality can be added without breaking existing code.
